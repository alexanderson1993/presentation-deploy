Continuous Deployment

Hooking up databases, APIs, and services

# What NOT to Expect

Continuous Integration - no testing and code validation

Front-end or back-end development frameworks or techniques

Logging, metrics, scaling, and durability


---

# What I assume

You know how to make web apps (somehow)

You know how to use Git

You are comfortable with a command line
